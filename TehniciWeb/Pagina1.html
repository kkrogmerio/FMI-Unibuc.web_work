                        Taking after the famous conference sessions named “Panels”, present at the great international conventions and festivals, East European Comic Con and Transylvania Comic Con hosts such an activity. Comic Con's Main Stage is a place where celebrities from
                        the movie and comic book industry joined us for a coffee and shared some of their experiences and also answered questions from the audience. In short the panels are Questions and Answers sessions with our guests. The Panels are
                        the perfect opportunity to hear celebrity speakers from your favorite sci-fi, horror, action and fantasy movies and television talk about their experiences in the business and their current or upcoming projects. It is a great opportunity
                        to ask questions and be entertained in person by your favorite celebrity. Starting with November 2014's ICE Comic Con, all panels with actors as well the rest of the panels are free, and you can enter with your general access ticket.
                        EECC and TCC has panels on the Main stage in Hall A at Romexpo or Main Hall at BT Arena Cluj-Napoca, where local and international online celebrities will join to entertain us and answer the fans' questions.
