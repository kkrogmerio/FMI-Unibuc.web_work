            <h2>Storyline</h2>
            <p>
                Joker centers around an origin of the iconic arch nemesis and is an original, standalone story not seen before on the big screen. Todd Phillips' exploration of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a man disregarded by society, is not only a gritty character study, but also a broader cautionary tale.

            <h2>Trivia</h2>
            <p>
                Joaquin Phoenix didn't say that he went mad doing the role of the title character What he actually said, during the movie's press conference: "The first thing for us was the weight loss. I think that's really what I started with. And, as it turns out, that then affects your psychology. You start to go mad when you lose that amount of weight in that amount of time" So context matters in this case. He is specifically referring to how one is physically and mentally impacted by dramatic weight loss in a short amount of time (he lost a reported 53 pounds for the role). You can extrapolate what you want from that quote and play up the angle of method-style commitment through physicaly transformation I'm sure it will come up a lot during the next few months of promotion but it's still an important distinction to make.

                <p><strong>10/10</strong></p>
                <p>
                    I have seen Joker yesterday at Venice an early ill-fated screening. We had some trouble with audio that lead to a near-hour delay, but it definitely was worth it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Joker deserved to be presented at Venice Film Festival, an event that regards cinema as a form of art, because this film is far from a blockbuster or a mere entertainer movie, as most films in the genre are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It focuses on the psyche of the main character, as it slowly crumbles under the pressure of society. And thus, Joaquin Phoenix does a wonderful performance, earning almost surely a nomination at the oscars at least. It's a take on the Joker that differs from Ledger's, but I'd say that both are equally as good. The main difference might be that Ledger's joker is a rational that acts insane, while Phoenix's is insane to the root.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite being a movie about a superhero villain, Joker is much superior to most of the movies of the genre (I'd exclude the Dark Knight Trilogy only, but Joker is easily as good as Nolan's movies, or at least very close). It is a small-scaled film, with a distinct style and cinematography (that cannot but be appreciated) and a set of very cinephile references that however do not feel too forced or overly opressive. (most notable are the similarities to Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' and his 'The King of Comedy', but also Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is somewhat referenced).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am eager to see more non-comedic efforts by Todd Phillips. This movie was so far probably the best of 2019 (at worst contested so far only by Dolor Y Gloria or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), and that should be very convincing

                <p><strong>10/10</strong></p>
                <p>Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour de force performance, fearless and stunning in its emotional depth and physicality. It's impossible to talk about this without referencing Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning performance from The Dark Knight, widely considered the definitive live-action portrayal of the Joker, so let's talk about it. The fact is, everyone is going to be stunned by what Phoenix accomplishes, because it's what many thought impossible - a portrayal that matches and potentially exceeds that of The Dark Knight's Clown Prince of Crime</p>

                <p><strong>1/10</strong></p>
                <p>
                    This movie is perfect for cringy edgemasters. Also a perfect oscar-bait movie which is boring,depressing and trying to hide that it has a very meaningful plot by keeping the tone dark,violent
